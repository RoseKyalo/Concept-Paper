## Introduction

Neurological disorders, which affect how the brain and nervous system function, have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, leading to various symptoms and impairments that significantly impact individuals and families. According to the most recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, neurological disorders are currently the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The number of people who died from neurological disorders over the last three decades has increased by 61%, from 5.5 million in 1990 to 8.8 million in 2019. The five largest contributors to neurological disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2016 were stroke (42.2%), migraine (16.3%), dementia (10.4%), meningitis (7.9%), and epilepsy (4.9%). These disorders are also common in low and middle-income countries. The study of neurological disorders has long been of interest due to its profound impact on individuals and families. In the USA and Europe alone, the annual cost of neurological disorders amounts to USD 1.7 trillion. Advancements in technology have led to the development of various diagnostic tools for neurological disorders. One such tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning for the fetal brain. When unusual behaviors or abnormalities are detected during prenatal sonography, a fetal MRI scan is conducted to diagnose any neurological disorders. Radiologists analyze these MRI images of the fetal brain to diagnose conditions, requiring familiarity with images at various gestation periods. However, disorders like autism are difficult to detect at such an early stage since they involve the evaluation of behavior and the baby's development. Early detection of neurological disorders is crucial for effective intervention and improved outcomes. While there is no cure for these disorders, early intervention can significantly alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. According to the World Health Organization's Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan and World Health Assembly Resolution WHA73.10, efforts are being made to bridge the gap of early detection by 2030. Unfortunately, current diagnostic methods often lack definitive medical tests and rely on behavioral evaluations, leading to delayed diagnoses. This project aims to curb this gap in early detection of neurological disorders, making it easier for both health practitioners and parents for better treatment.



## Research Questions
1.	How do neurological disorders influence the overall burden of life?

2.	To what extent does early detection of neurological disorders contribute to the improvement of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)?
   
## Literature review
In recent years, there has been significant research into using advanced computer techniques, particularly deep learning, to better understand and diagnose neurological disorders. However, this area faces several challenges, including limited access to large datasets, imbalances in the types of data available, and difficulties in making predictions in real-time. Studies focusing on analyzing EEG and MRI data have shown promising results in the automated detection of seizures and recognizing anomalies associated with neurological disorders. Additionally, researchers have explored the use of facial expression recognition methods as a complementary approach to identifying signs of these disorders. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been employed to improve the accuracy of classification tasks. Despite advancements, challenges persist in effectively removing artifacts and reducing noise from EEG data, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Moreover, recent studies, such as the work by Groos et al., have delved into using deep learning models based on video analysis to identify patterns indicative of early-stage neurological disorders. Furthermore, advancements in technology have led to the development of speech monitoring and recording devices aimed at rapidly detecting anomalies and analyzing speech difficulties, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention.
